# PiSearch
Credits to Dave Andersen for the original idea (pi-textsearch.py was made to find strings for letter combinations on HIS website lol)
Why doesn't it work?
1) You have the script saved to the wrong drive (this was made for D:\ drives)
2) You don't have pi-billion.txt installed. Get it at https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/pi/pi-billion.txt/
3) encodings.txt is either empty or nonexistent.

To look for your own numbers, use pi-numsearch.py and provide your own numbers in encodings.txt
